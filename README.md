It is my college project, which is a Full-Stack Web Application. The project is "College- Attendance-Management-System" which will help teachers maintain daily attendance and it will also help students to track their attendance on a real-time basis.
We have used technologies like React.js, Node.js, MySQL, bootstrap, express, etc.
